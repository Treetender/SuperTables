# Supertable

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6.

## So What is this?
I want to really play around with autmated CI builds and to experiment with streaming large sets of data to datatables asynchronously.

This project is hosted in [Github Pages]() and will be updated every time a pull request is merged into master.  If the unit tests fail, or if the code is invalid, the build will fail.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
